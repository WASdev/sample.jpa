Java Persistence API (JPA) Sample [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.jpa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.jpa)
==============


The JPA sample contains a server definition which includes the Servlet, JDBC and JPA features. It also contains a very simple JPA application, jpaApp.war, which contains a single servlet, JPAServlet. This servlet persists a JPA entity (named "Thing") to a derby database and then retrieves the entiry from the database.


## Running in Eclipse with Maven

1. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Maven Project'.
2. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Clean**.
3. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Install**.
4. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Build...** then run the goal `liberty:run-server`.
5. You should see the following in the console: `Application JPA Sample started in XX.XX seconds.`

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in] to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server.

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9080/jpaApp/](http://localhost:9080/jpaApp/) (where port 9080 assumes the httpEndpoint provided in the sample server.xml has not been modified).
In your browser, you should see the message `Hello JPA World` followed by information about the entity being persisted to and retrieved from the database.

## Running with Gradle

This project can also be built and run with [Gradle]. The provided `build.gradle` file applies the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in] and is configured to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE7 Web Profile runtime from Maven Central. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in has built-in tasks that can be used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server.

Use the following steps to run the application with Gradle:

1. Execute the full Gradle build. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ gradle clean build
    ```

2. To start the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStart
    ```

    Alternatively, execute the run command:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyRun --no-daemon
    ```

Once the server has started, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/jpaApp](http://localhost:9080/jpaApp).

3. To stop the server, execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStop
    ```  

Please refer to the [ci.gradle] repository for documentation about using the Liberty Gradle Plug-in.
